| What is computer networking? | The practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.                                |
| Key communication protocols  | TCP/IP suite used for reliable data transmission between hosts.                                              |
| Networking hardware          | Routers direct traffic between networks; switches forward frames within a LAN.                               |
| Network topologies           | Star, mesh, bus â€“ different organizational structures for connecting devices.                                |
| LAN vs. WAN                  | LAN: local area network (e.g., within a building); WAN: wide area network spanning large geographical areas. |
| IP addressing & subnetting   | Assigning unique IP addresses; dividing networks into subnets for efficient routing and management.          |
| DNS (Domain Name System)     | Resolves human-readable domain names to IP addresses for resource location.                                  |
| Network security measures    | Firewalls, encryption (SSL/TLS), access authentication to protect data and resources.                        |

## Summary
> Networking fundamentals cover protocols like TCP/IP, hardware components such as routers and switches, various topologies (star, mesh, bus), and key concepts including IP addressing, DNS, and security measures, enabling efficient data sharing and connectivity across LANs and WANs.
