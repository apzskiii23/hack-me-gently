| Common Symptoms                     | Hardware: overheating, physical damage; Software: slow performance, unresponsiveness.                                                 |
| Basic Troubleshooting Process       | 1. Identify the problem<br>2. Research and analyze<br>3. Develop a plan<br>4. Test and implement<br>5. Document process and findings. |
| Identify the problem                | Gather info on symptoms, reproduce issue, note error messages and unusual behaviors.                                                  |
| Research and analyze                | Search forums, vendor docs, web resources for causes and remedies.                                                                    |
| Develop a plan                      | Formulate least disruptive strategy first, consider risks.                                                                            |
| Test and implement                  | Execute solution, verify resolution; if not fixed, repeat process with new plan.                                                      |
| Document process and findings       | Record steps taken, solutions applied, and results to improve future troubleshooting.                                                 |
| Hardware isolation                  | Disconnect peripherals, reconnect one-by-one to find faulty component.                                                                |
| Resource usage monitoring           | Use tools (e.g., Task Manager, top) to check CPU, memory, disk for bottlenecks.                                                       |
| Software configuration verification | Examine configuration files and settings for misconfigurations.                                                                       |
| Network troubleshooting             | 1. Verify physical connectivity<br>2. Confirm IP configuration<br>3. Test with ping/traceroute.                                       |
| Log analysis                        | 1. Identify relevant logs<br>2. Analyze events and error patterns<br>3. Use log-analysis tools to parse/filter large logs.            |

## Summary
> Effective troubleshooting follows a systematic process—identifying, researching, planning, testing, and documenting—while isolating components, monitoring resources, verifying settings, and analyzing logs to pinpoint and resolve issues across any operating system.
