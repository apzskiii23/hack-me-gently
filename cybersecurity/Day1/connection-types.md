| Ethernet                 | Wired LAN connection with high speed (100 Mbps to several Gbps), stability and security; used in business and critical setups. |
| Wi-Fi                    | Wireless connection without cables; flexible and mobile, but less reliable and slower than Ethernet due to interference.       |
| Bluetooth                | Short-range wireless tech (up to ~10 m) for peripherals (headphones, keyboards); not for large-scale networking.               |
| Fiber-optic Connections  | Uses glass/plastic fibers to transmit light at very high speeds over long distances; ideal for backbones but costly.           |
| Cellular Connections     | Mobile 4G/5G networks offering internet almost anywhere; speed and reliability depend on coverage.                             |

## Summary
> Network connections balance speed, reliability, distance, and convenience, from wired Ethernet to wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, through high-speed fiber-optic backbones to mobile cellular networks.
