| CPU (Central Processing Unit)  | The “brain” of the computer. Executes instructions and processes data.                                     |
| Motherboard                    | Main circuit board. Connects and allows communication between CPU, memory, and other hardware components.  |
| RAM (Random Access Memory)     | Short-term memory. Stores data actively being used by the CPU for quick access.                            |
| Storage (HDD / SSD)            | Long-term data storage. HDDs use spinning disks; SSDs use flash memory. Holds OS, applications, and files. |
| PSU (Power Supply Unit)        | Provides electrical power to run all components.                                                           |
| GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) | Renders images and video. Crucial for gaming, video editing, and machine learning tasks.                   |
| Input Devices                  | Keyboards, mice. Allow users to send data and commands to the system.                                      |
| Output Devices                 | Monitors, printers. Enable users to receive data and results from the system.                              |
