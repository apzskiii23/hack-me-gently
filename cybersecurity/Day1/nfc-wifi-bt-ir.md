| NFC (Near Field Communication) | Very short-range (~10 cm) wireless tech; used for contactless payments, access cards, and quick data exchange by bringing devices close together.     |
| Bluetooth                      | Short-range (~10 m) wireless connection for peripherals like headphones, keyboards; useful for personal area networks (PAN).                          |
| Wi-Fi                          | Wireless LAN standard using 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands; enables devices to connect to local networks and internet without cables.                        |
| Infrared                       | Line-of-sight optical communication using IR light; common in TV remotes and some industrial sensors; range ~1–2 m, no penetration through obstacles. |
